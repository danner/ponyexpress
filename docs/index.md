# Welcome to pony-express

We are currently in the process of hosting our full documentation @ [Nullindex](http://www.nullindex.com)!

Otherwise, this is a library which aims to be your one-stop-shopping for all things shipping related. Whether you're working with [USPS](https://www.usps.com/), [UPS](http://www.ups.com/), or [FedEx](http://www.fedex.com/).

As of today, July 25th 2015, we are still working on version 0.1.0 and only have partial support for USPS, but we are growing at a rapid rate!

If you're interested in contributing to this library, please make a pull request! A quick note on this is that we play a little game with coverage, where a new commit cannot lower the coverage. If I get a commit with no tests, I won't even consider accepting it.
